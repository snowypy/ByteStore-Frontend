                The information provided when using the Services is not intended for distribution to or use by any
                person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law
                or regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or
                country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Services from other locations do so on
                their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent
                local laws are applicable.<br/><br/>

                The Services are not tailored to comply with industry-specific regulations (such as Health Insurance
                Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), etc.).
                Therefore, if your interactions would be subjected to such laws, you may not use the Services. You may
                not use the Services in a way that would violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).<br/><br/>

                Please note that we are a group of independent developers and not a legal company. As such, we do not
                assume any formal business entity or corporate structure, and the Services are provided on a
                non-commercial, collaborative basis.<br/><br/>
